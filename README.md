# NhapLuu (Nhập Lưu) - Stream Entry Path

https://cschanhniem.github.io/nhapluu/

> A modern web application guiding practitioners toward Stream Entry (Sotāpanna) in the 21st century

## Overview

**NhapLuu** (Vietnamese: Nhập Lưu, Pāli: Sotāpanna) is a comprehensive digital platform designed to support Buddhist practitioners on their journey toward the first stage of enlightenment - Stream Entry. In an age of digital distraction and information overload, this application provides structured guidance, tracking, and community support for serious Dhamma practice.

### What is Stream Entry (Sotāpanna)?

Stream Entry is the first of four stages of enlightenment in Theravada Buddhism, characterized by:
- Breaking the first three fetters (saṃyojana):
  1. Self-identity view (sakkāya-diṭṭhi)
  2. Doubt (vicikicchā)
  3. Attachment to rites and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa)
- Unwavering confidence in the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha)
- Guaranteed enlightenment within seven lifetimes

## Core Philosophy

The path to Stream Entry in the 21st century requires:

1. **Noble Friends** (Kalyāṇamittā) - Spiritual community and guidance
2. **Listening to True Dhamma** (Saddhamma-savana) - Access to authentic teachings
3. **Wise Attention** (Yoniso-manasikāra) - Proper mental cultivation
4. **Practice in Accordance with Dhamma** (Dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti) - Consistent application

This application modernizes these timeless principles for contemporary practitioners.
